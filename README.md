# ðŸ’µ laundry-tracking ðŸ‘•
I quite often find myself forgetting how much money I've put on my laundry card and when I did my laundry, so I got the idea to make this while doing my laundry one day. 

### ðŸ’» the program
I use .txt files for history and my balance, the program reads and changes the balance based on given inputs, and it can calculate my new balance given a number of loads, where a wash cycle is $2.20 and a dry cycle is $2.00. Any added or removed funds are added to history.txt along with a timestamp so I know exactly how much I spent on that day.

### ðŸ’­thoughts
This was a neat little project, it took about an hour and a half to code and was a really nice exercise in reading/writing .txt files. It could 100% be improved but it was good enough for what I needed.
