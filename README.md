# ğŸ’µ laundry-tracking ğŸ‘•
I quite often find myself forgetting how much money I've put on my laundry card and when I did that, so I got the idea to make this while doing my laundry one day. Whether or not I commit to using it is a different story.

The code itself admittedly isn't pretty, but it does seem to work the way I intended.
